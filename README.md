# Alexis - Portfolio

-----

This project is built on [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/) as a project during my BTS at the [CCI Campus](https://www.ccicampus.fr/) of Strasbourg. 
The goal is to learn how to use the [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Glossary/MVC) (Model-View-Controllers) pattern.
During the project I had to rewrite my portfolio using Laravel. Using the MVC pattern, Eloquent, Routes, and all features of the Framework.
We need to setup a [CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Glossary/CRUD).
