# Alexis - Portfolio

-----


This project is built on [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/) as a project during my BTS at the [CCI Campus](https://www.ccicampus.fr/) of Strasbourg. 
The goal is to learn how to use the [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Glossary/MVC) (Model-View-Controllers) pattern.
During the project I had to rewrite my portfolio using Laravel. Using the MVC pattern, Eloquent, Routes, and all features of the Framework.
We need to setup a [CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Glossary/CRUD) features.

## Installation

**If you want to setup the project, you will need to follow the followings steps**

First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub, with the following command :

`git clone https://github.com/AlxisHenry/CCI-2021-PORTFOLIO.git`

At the root of the project, you will see a setup file.

**You just have to launch it.**

> **WARN** :
- The default admin user is root:root (username: root, password: root),
- If you want to import default data, your database name need to be "main",
- If you want to run all tests, be sure your .env is configured and the database,
- A lot of commands are available in package.json.

If you need to work on the project, I recommend you to work with the ``php artisan serve``.
